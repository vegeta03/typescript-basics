# TypeScript basics

- TypeScript is just normal JavaScript with types and some modern programming language features added on top of it.
- TypeScript is a Superset of JavaScript.
- Browser can't run TypeScript code natively, it can only run JavaScript code natively. So the TypeScript compiler transpiles the TypeScript code to optimized JavaScript code for the browser to run it natively.
- Everything in JavaScript is valid in TypeScript.
- TypeScript is used by two types of developers:
  1. Developers using TypeScript to develop applications
  2. Developers using TypeScript to develop libraries for other developers to use.
